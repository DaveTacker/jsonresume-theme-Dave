## Example
http://themes.jsonresume.org/theme/dave

## Running

```sh
# If you need to install Node.js:
#    sudo apt-get install npm
sudo npm install -g resume-cli
git clone https://github.com/kneeki/jsonresume-theme-Dave.git
cd jsonresume-theme-dave
sudo npm install
resume serve
```
You can print directly from the served html.

## Options

You may toggle `SORT__KEYWORDS` to alphabetically sort the keywords (useful for long arrays) and `CLEAN_DATES` to use shortened dates. See `index.js`.

This theme supports a modified `resume.json` schema which allows you to add a seperate 'experience' category.

```json
"experience": [
    {
        "organization": "United States Navy",
        "position": "Culinary Specialist",
        "website": "",
        "startDate": "2001-08-01",
        "endDate": "2005-08-01",
        "summary": "",
        "highlights": [
            "Good Conduct Medal",
            "Global War on Terrorism Service Medal",
            "National Defense Service Medal",
            "Submarine Insignia",
            "SSBN Service Patrol Pin (4 patrols)"
        ]
    }
],
```
